# ML & AI on Snowflake with Chase

Welcome to the **Machine Learning & AI on Snowflake** learning repository! This repo is designed to teach data scientists, ML engineers, and analytics professionals how to build, deploy, and manage modern AI/ML solutions directly on the Snowflake.

Whether you're new to Snowflake's machine learning capabilities or looking to deepen your expertise, this repository walks you through hands-on examples and reusable patterns for real-world use cases.

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn

This repository covers the following core areas:

### 1. Simple MLOps with Batch Inference
- Train and register ML models using Snowflake Model Registry.
- Deploy models for batch scoring using Dynamic Tables and a Warehouse.

### 2. Simple MLOps with Online Inference
- Train and register ML models using Snowflake Model Registry.
- Create a compute pool to host your model
- Create a service for executng you model as an endpoint

### 3. Agent Framework with Cortex Analysts & Search
- How to build agent-based frameworks that utilize multiple Analysts and Search services
- Leverage the open source [orchestration framework]([https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/building_scalable_time_series_forecasting_models_on_snowflake/index.html#0](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/orchestration-framework)) developed by Snowlfake Solution Innovation Team.

### 4. Time Series Forecasting
- Build a robust forecasting framework that can handle many partitions
- Leverage [snowflake scalable time series solution]([https://github.com/your-org/ml-ai-on-snowflake/tree/main/agent-framework](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/building_scalable_time_series_forecasting_models_on_snowflake/index.html#0))


### 5. Entity Resolution
- Leverage batch cortex search to link records across large datasets.
